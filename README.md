Adjusting volume by editing the values of the .wav files bytes. Didn't realise there was code you could download and finish off from the course so this will look very different to what's expected. That said it still passes all the tasks. 

Spent 2 hours trying to get it to pass the tests. Originally the program was adjusting the volume just fine but shaved off the header every time I saved the new file. Had to look at the size of the file to realise it was doing this. This version should have no problems with that.
